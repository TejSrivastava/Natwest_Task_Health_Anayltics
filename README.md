# Natwest_Task_Health_Anayltics
Problem Statement:
As a part of the assessment you are supposed to analyse the logs from https://github.com/logpai/loghub/tree/master/HealthApp and build analytics solutions i.e. when does the person work-out, how many steps he took on daily basis, what are his active times etc. The more analytics you generate better it will be for evaluation. Analytics should have better visualisation in form of graphs. Use Python or Java as the language of choice

Data Analysis Report

Methodology:
In this data analysis task, log data from a health application was provided, which included columns such as 'LineId', 'Time', 'Component', 'Pid', 'Content', 'EventId', and 'EventTemplate'. The objective was to analyze this data and extract meaningful insights regarding the user's behavior, workout patterns, and active times.

Step 1: Data Preprocessing
I began by loading the data into a pandas DataFrame and checked for missing values, data types, and basic statistics.
The 'Time' column was converted to a datetime object to enable time-based analysis.
Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualizations
I performed extensive EDA and created a variety of visualizations to gain insights into the data.

Challenges Faced:
Data Quality: 
The data preprocessing phase revealed missing or inconsistent data, which required careful handling to avoid bias in the analysis.
Complexity of Health Data: Health data often exhibits complex patterns, making it challenging to extract meaningful insights. Visualization was crucial in simplifying these patterns.
Large Dataset: Handling a large dataset can be resource-intensive. Efficient coding practices and using appropriate libraries were essential.

Insights Gained:
Temporal Patterns: I identified temporal patterns in user activity, such as daily peaks and valleys, indicating when the user is most active.
Workout Durations: Insights into workout duration distributions can help in customizing workout plans or setting goals.
Component Usage: Understanding which components of the health app are most frequently used can guide feature development and optimization efforts.
Monthly and Weekly Trends: Recognizing trends by month and day of the week can inform marketing and engagement strategies.
Steps vs. Duration: The relationship between steps and workout duration can help in assessing the intensity of workouts.
User Segmentation: By analyzing data by Pid, I can segment users based on their behavior for personalized recommendations.

Conclusion:
This data analysis revealed valuable insights into user behavior in a health application. Understanding when users are most active, their workout patterns, and which components of the app are most popular can guide decisions related to app development, marketing, and user engagement. The visualizations provided a clear and interpretable representation of complex data patterns, facilitating decision-making processes
