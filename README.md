# Natwest_Task_Health_Anayltics
Problem Statement:
As a part of the assessment you are supposed to analyse the logs from https://github.com/logpai/loghub/tree/master/HealthApp and build analytics solutions i.e. when does the person work-out, how many steps he took on daily basis, what are his active times etc. The more analytics you generate better it will be for evaluation. Analytics should have better visualisation in form of graphs. Use Python or Java as the language of choice
